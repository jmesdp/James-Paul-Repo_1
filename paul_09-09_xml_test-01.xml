1. The root element is ingredients
2. Descriptive markups in XML label specifc parts of piece of text without providing instructions on
how the text should be displayed. Presentational markups on the other hand give cues on text's  
structure and specify's how the text should be displayed and/or formatted.
    a) Descriptive: <character> superman </character>. This is a descriptive markup because it
    simply labels a part of the text — the occcurance of the word supermnan — as belonging to the 
    character class. 
    b) Presentational: <bold> superman </bold>. This is a presentational markup because it gives 
    an instruction to display the character's that make up the word superman in bold, without commenting
    on the meaning of the words or the class it belongs to. This type of markup instructs how
    the text should be displayed — in this case in bold.
    c) In digital humanities projects, where the aim is to answer central research questions on
    meaning spread across a corpus, descriptive markups capture the meaning of the text without
    relying on visual cues, such as structure. These markups can be used to interpret thematic and
    semantic meaning of a corpus by identifying recurring content.
3. The following scenarios would cause a well-formedness error:
    B - This would cause and error because the tag "speaker" has already been assigned to the 
    character homer when it's reused on bart. When an element has two tags belonging to the 
    same class, the name of the tag should be changed on subsequent occurences. 
        a. Corrected element: <speech speaker1="homer" speaker2="bart">Doh!</speech>
    D - This is not well formed because the system would read the element as containing
    two seperate attributes of main and speaker, without the former being assigned a value.
        a. Corrected element: <speech main_speaker="Gertrude">
                              </speech>
        b. Explanation: This corrects the error by concatenating the attribute into a single
        element with the use of an underscore. The system would then view it as only one
        element.
    F - This would give an error as XML is capitalization sensitve and would view the start 
    and end-tags as completly seperate. The system would see the start tag as having no
    end and the end tag as having no start. To correct this the form of the text
    should be kept consistent.
        a. Corrected element: <line> If it be,</line>
                              <line> Why seems it so particular with these?</line>
    G - This would cause an error as XML documents must have a single root element that contains
    all other elements, which need to be encapsulated with a conistent start and end tag. Without
    one, the XML reader wouldn't know how to format the information.
        a. Corrected element: <stooges>
                              <stooge> Curly </stooge>
                              <stooge> Larry </stooge>
                              <stooge> Moe </stooge>
                              </stooges>
    H - This wouldn't work because XML would read the less than sign as starting an element. All 
    subsequent text would be read as XML markups and not actual text.
        a. Corrected element: <equation> 1 &lt 2 </equation>
        b. Explanation: &lt is a pre-defined XML statement used to demarcate the less than symbol. It
        should be used to preserve the meaning of the text while still making it XML readable.
    J - This would cause a red square to appear because XML follows a nesting structure where each element
    needs to be contained within its parent element. This example would break this structure because the quote
    element is broken up by line elements, which would lead the XML reader to become confused over where
    the quote element starts and ends. To fix this, the quote element needs to be opened and closed 
    within the line element.
        a. Corrected element: <stanza>
                                    <line> abc </line>
                                    <line>
                                    <quote> abc               
                                    </quote>
                                    </line>
                              </stanza>
